The Problem
Planning any outdoor event, from a local parade to a family picnic, is often overshadowed by a simple question: "Will it rain?" The sheer volume of available weather data can make getting a straightforward, reliable prediction for a specific future date a challenging task, leaving plans at the mercy of uncertainty.

Our Solution
Protect My Parade is our answer to this uncertainty. We have built a web application that uses live meteorological data to automatically analyze and forecast the probability of rain for any given location and date. The application's interface is not just informative but also immersive, with animated backgrounds that change to reflect the forecast, making the experience intuitive and engaging.

‚ú® Features:
AI-Powered Voice Control: Interact with the application hands-free. Simply ask for a forecast using natural language to get an instant vocal and visual response.

Clear Results: View a clear rain probability percentage and a straightforward message, removing all guesswork from your planning.

Dynamic Visual Feedback: The application‚Äôs background instantly transforms with animations that reflect the weather forecast (Sunny, Rainy, Cloudy, etc.).

Simple & Intuitive UI: A clean and accessible design that makes complex weather data easy to understand at a glance.

Trip Planner: Get suggestions on what to pack for your event based on the weather prediction.

Light/Dark Mode: Switch between themes for your viewing comfort.
