The Problem:

Planning an outdoor event, be it a parade, a picnic, or a party, always comes with a nagging uncertainty: "Will it rain?" Constantly checking different weather apps can be tedious, and they often don't provide a simple, clear probability for a specific future date, leaving you to guess. This makes it difficult to plan with confidence.

Our Solution:

Protect My Parade is our answer to this uncertainty. We have built a web application that uses live weather forecast data to provide a straightforward rain probability for any city on any given date. The application's interface is not just informative but also immersive, with animated backgrounds that change to reflect the forecast, making the experience intuitive and engaging.

Our AI Voice Assistant The application features a voice-enabled assistant that allows for hands-free interaction. Users can simply ask questions like, "What's the weather in Hyderabad tomorrow?" and receive a spoken response along with the updated visual forecast. This is powered by the browser's built-in Web Speech API for recognition and synthesis.

Live Data & Dynamic UI Our application connects to a real-time weather API (Open-Meteo) to fetch up-to-date forecast data. This data is then processed by our Python backend, which feeds the results to the frontend. The user interface responds instantly, updating the animated background, prediction text, and temperature, providing a rich and seamless user experience.
